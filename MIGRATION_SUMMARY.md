# Docker to Native Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the Radio Stream Recorder API from a Docker-containerized application to a native Python application.

## Files Removed

- `Dockerfile` - Docker container configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose orchestration
- `.dockerignore` - Docker build context exclusions

## Files Added

- `install.sh` - Automated installation script for native deployment
- `start.sh` - Application startup script with environment configuration
- `radio-recorder-api.service` - systemd service template for production deployment
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This migration summary document

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files

#### `main.py`
- Changed default paths from container paths to relative paths:
  - `/config` → `./config`
  - `/work` → `./work`
  - `/ssh/id_rsa` → `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- Updated health check documentation from "container monitoring" to "service monitoring"

### Documentation Files

#### `README.md`
- Removed all Docker-related installation and deployment instructions
- Added native installation instructions with automated and manual options
- Replaced Docker Compose deployment with systemd service configuration
- Updated environment variable defaults to use relative paths
- Added sections for helper scripts (`install.sh`, `start.sh`)
- Updated troubleshooting section to use native log locations
- Changed security considerations from container-based to native application security

#### `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Updated security section from "Container Security" to "Application Security"
- Changed deployment references from Docker to native Python
- Updated maintenance recommendations from Docker images to Python dependencies

#### `config/README.md`
- Updated artwork file path examples from `/config/artwork/` to `./config/artwork/`
- Changed timezone configuration reference from Docker environment to environment variables
- Replaced Docker volume mapping section with native directory structure
- Updated troubleshooting commands from `docker logs` to native log file access

### Specification Files

#### `Prompts/Kiro_API_Spec_with_Docker.md` → `Prompts/Kiro_API_Spec_Native.md`
- Renamed file to reflect native deployment approach
- Updated goal statement to remove Docker container hosting
- Changed "Dockerization Requirements" to "Native Deployment Requirements"
- Replaced Docker skeleton configurations with native installation requirements
- Updated directory structure and deployment instructions

#### `Prompts/original-prompt.txt`
- Changed from "hosted in Docker" to "runs natively on the host system"
- Updated container mounting references to local directory usage

#### `.kiro/specs/radio-stream-recorder-api/requirements.md`
- Updated introduction to remove Docker container hosting
- Changed user story from Docker container to native system deployment
- Updated acceptance criteria from container-based to application-based

#### `.kiro/specs/radio-stream-recorder-api/design.md`
- Changed "Container Architecture" to "Application Architecture"
- Updated volume mounts to native directory structure
- Replaced Docker-specific configurations with native application settings
- Updated security considerations from container to native application security

#### `.kiro/specs/radio-stream-recorder-api/tasks.md`
- Replaced Docker container configuration tasks with native deployment tasks
- Updated task descriptions from container-based to native installation
- Changed testing tasks from Docker deployment to native deployment testing

## Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables
- Default paths changed from absolute container paths to relative host paths:
  - `APP_CONFIG_DIR`: `/config` → `./config`
  - `APP_WORK_DIR`: `/work` → `./work`
  - `APP_SSH_KEY`: `/ssh/id_rsa` → `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

### Directory Structure
- Configuration files now use relative paths
- Working directory created in project root
- SSH key uses standard user home directory location

## Deployment Changes

### Before (Docker)
- Required Docker and Docker Compose
- Used container orchestration
- Mounted volumes for configuration and data
- Container-based health checks
- Docker networking and security

### After (Native)
- Requires Python 3.11+ and system dependencies
- Uses Python virtual environment
- Direct file system access
- systemd service for production
- Host-based security and networking

## New Features

### Installation Script (`install.sh`)
- Automated dependency checking
- Virtual environment creation
- Directory structure setup
- Configuration file copying
- SSH key permission validation

### Startup Script (`start.sh`)
- Environment variable configuration
- Development and production modes
- Configuration validation
- Easy development server startup

### systemd Service Template
- Production deployment configuration
- Automatic restart capabilities
- Security hardening options
- Proper user and group settings

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Simplified Deployment**: No Docker dependency, easier to install on various systems
2. **Better Performance**: No container overhead, direct system access
3. **Easier Development**: Native Python debugging and development tools
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer moving parts, simpler troubleshooting
5. **Better Integration**: Direct system integration, easier monitoring and logging

## Migration Steps for Existing Users

1. **Stop Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Backup configuration and data**:
   ```bash
   cp -r config config_backup
   cp -r work work_backup
   ```

3. **Run installation script**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. **Restore configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp config_backup/* config/
   ```

5. **Start native application**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

6. **Set up systemd service** (optional, for production):
   ```bash
   sudo cp radio-recorder-api.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl enable radio-recorder-api
   sudo systemctl start radio-recorder-api
   ```

## Compatibility Notes

- All API endpoints remain unchanged
- Configuration file formats are identical
- Recording workflow and metadata processing unchanged
- SCP transfer functionality preserved
- Health check endpoints maintained

The migration maintains full functional compatibility while simplifying deployment and improving system integration.
